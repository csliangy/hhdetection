The source code is for the following paper:

Liang Yang, Bryan Ng, Winston K.G. Seah, Lindsay Groves, "Deterministic Confidence Interval Estimation of Networking Traffic in SDN", Local Computer Networks (LCN) 2017 IEEE 42nd Conference on, pp. 120-127, 2017. 

This project was conducted three years ago and also the first time I was using Matlab and Python. The code strcture and quality is not in good shape. But I received several requests to share the source code because they would like to reproduce this experiment. No copyright reserved and feel free to use it.
